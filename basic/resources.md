## API Gateway

An API gateway takes all API calls from clients, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing, composition, and protocol translation. Typically it handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results, to determine the best path. It can translate between web protocols and web‑unfriendly protocols that are used internally.

An e‑commerce site might use an API gateway to provide mobile clients with an endpoint for retrieving all product details with a single request. It invokes various services, like product info and reviews, and combines the results.

## Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation/Capacity Planning

A back-of-the-envelope calculation uses estimated or rounded numbers to develop a ballpark figure quickly. The result should be more accurate than a guess, as it involves putting thought to paper, but it will be less accurate than a formal calculation performed using precise numbers and a spreadsheet or calculator.
